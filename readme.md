## Usage

Run the bot using the following terminal command:

<ins>Note</ins>: the first time you run the bot, you will need to authenticate your account using the phone number and the verification code sent to your Telegram account.

In the bot's folder you will have 6 files:
- `main.py`: the main file to run the bot.
- `localization.py`: contains the bot's messages in different languages.
